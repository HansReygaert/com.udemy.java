Create a Class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques
The class will be called Printer
It will simulate a real computer printer
It should have fields for the toner, level, number of pages printed and
also whether it's a duplex printer (capable of printing on both sides of the paper)
An methods to fill up the toner (up to a max of 100%) another method to
simulate printing a page (which should increase the number of pages printed)
Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you thing is needed>
