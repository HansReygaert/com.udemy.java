We are going to go back to the car analogy
Create a base class called Car
It should have a few fields that would be appropriate for a generic car class:
engine, cylinders, wheels, etc

Constructor should inittialize cylinders (number of) and name, and set wheels to 4 and engine to true

Create appropriate getters

Create some methods like startEngine, Accelerate and brake

Show a message for each in the base class
Now create 3 sub classes for your favorite vehicles
Override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorphism in use
put all classes in the one jave file
